It’s just a lie.” \n- The Wire, season 5 episode 84  \n \nIn the following excerpt of a June 2012 conversation, EDU president and CFO Louis Hsieh is either \nlying or demonstrating that he is being lied to.  As we show in this report, it is indisputable that EDU \nhas an extensive franchising operation.  It is virtually certain that EDU has been consolidating the \nfinancials of its franchisees into its own financials. \n \nWe encourage investors to listen to the recording of this conversation at \nhttp://www.muddywatersresearch.com/watch-the-video-edu.  \n \nQ: “Do you franchise any of your stores?” \n \nHsieh: “No.  No.  Our biggest asset, the reason our moat is so large is cause of our brand name.  \nWe will protect that.  [inaudible]  We own everything.” \n \nQ: “So the four hundred and thirty learning centers…” \n \nHsieh: “We own all of them.”   \n \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Calculation based on RMB revenue, and excludes currency fluctuations. 2 Store count number includes schools and learning centers; it excludes book stores. 3 Props to Shakespeare for the original line in Hamlet Act III, Scene II “The lady doth protest too much, methinks.”  4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarifications  \n1 of 96"

      "Q: “How many?  I’m sorry.” \n \nHsieh: “It’s six hundred and fifty.” \n \nQ: “Learning centers and schools?  It’s a mix?” \n \nHsieh: “Yeah.  Over six hundred.  About six hundred and fifty.  We own everything.” \n \nQ: “A hundred percent fully-owned?” \n \nHsieh: “Yes.” \n \nQ: “I see.  And do you have any arrangements, in terms of, you know, capital, capex, or cost \nsharing, or profit sharing, or any type of cooperation?” \n \nHsieh: “No.” \n \nQ: “With others?” \n \nHsieh: “Nope.  All ours.  We’ve grown completely organically.  We owe nobody. \n \nQ: “Purely organic, a hundred percent owned by New Oriental?” \n \nHsieh: “Correct.  Absolutely correct.  That’s how we control the quality.”   \n \nIntroduction \n \nNew Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (“EDU”) is lying to shareholders about its store \ngrowth and financial performance.  As is typical of many of the frauds we have witnessed in China, \nhow EDU actually conducts its business differs materially from what it tells investors.  Inside China, \nEDU has an extensive and long-standing franchising operation.  We know this because we have \nlistened to discussions between EDU and a potential franchisee.  Outside China, EDU’s president / \nCFO Louis Hsieh vehemently denies the existence of any franchising or financial sharing arrangements \nwhatsoever.   \n \nWe have evidence that EDU’s franchising operation covers dozens of cities, including its original Tier \n1 markets, and that the franchising includes both POP Kids and traditional format stores.  However, \nEDU has never disclosed any information related to franchising.  It is virtually certain that EDU uses \nthe front-end weighted franchise fees it receives to game its cash balance confirmation during its audit.  \nIt is also virtually certain that EDU consolidates its franchisees’ results as though they were EDU’s \nown.  This has a number of other implications for numbers reported since going public in September \n2006, including: \n \n• 37.0% revenue CAGR built on 29.1% store count CAGR from FY2006 to FY2011. \n•  Capital expenditures since going public of approximately $104 million. \n• 19.5% enrollment CAGR. \n• 41.0% teacher and 39.8% non-teacher employee count CAGRs. \n2 of 96"
